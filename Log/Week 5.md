This hilarious function causes an earthquake and it's really funny.
There's also a side effect where the background doesn't cover the shaken area and you can still see the snow particles that are normally out of bounds. This is fully intentional i think it's even funnier.

Now also added meteor strike.

This causes a meteor to fall and the screen turns white as it lands. Also lots of shaking for funny value. Also made snow particles slightly transparent. This is also random.
